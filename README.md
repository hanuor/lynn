Lynn is a J2EE based 'template messenger' that works on top of SMTP protocol. 
In not so technical terms: Lynn is purely written in Java and is forever free to use. 
If you are a frequent Gmail user you'd probably have come across a problem of copy and pasting an email everytime you have to send it to a new user with the contents being almost the same except maybe two or three words. 
What's at risk you ask? Your productivity, your concentration and your precious time. 
With Lynn you can store a template and use a separator (#*#) to indicate that yeah these might be the words that you may replace when you'll use the template. Simple as that.

Now, next time you want to send an email to someone or a group of people just add those email ids (separated by a ';') and then add them fields. Lynn will automatically replace those separators(#*#) with the fields. 

Research shows that this saves upto around 13 mins of your time per hour. That adds upto 312 minutes (5.2 hours) in 24 hours (Now that's a lot of time you waste **until now**).

### Usage

You need to grant a permission first so that Gmail allows you to send an email from a 'less secure app' (third party).
